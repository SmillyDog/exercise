basic algorithm and data structure

## classics
some classic problems and their algorithm.
+ *Mouse in a maze*
+ *Monotonous stack*


## tree
some problems involved in tree
* *Binary Tree*
    1. construction
    2. number of nodes in a tree
    3. the depth or height of a tree
    4. the number of nodes in layer k
    5. the number of leaf nodes in a tree
    6. whethere two tree have the same structure
    7. if a tree is an AVL
    8. the mirror of a tree
    9. reconstruct the binary tree based on the pre-order and in-order of the tree
* *Traversal*
	1. pre-order traversal of a binary tree
	2. in-order traversal
	3. post-order traversal
	4. layer traversal
