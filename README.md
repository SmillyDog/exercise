# exercise in data structure
basic algorithm and data structure

## classics
some classic problems and their algorithm.
* -Mouse in a maze-
* -Monotonous stack-

## tree
some problems involved in tree
* *Binary Tree*

    1. construction

    2. number of nodes in a tree

    3. the depth or height of a tree

    4. the number of nodes in layer k

    5. the number of leaf nodes in a tree

    6. whethere two tree have the same structure

    7. if a tree is an AVL

    8. the mirror of a tree

    9. reconstruct the binary tree based on the pre-order and in-order of the tree

* *Traversal*
	1. pre-order traversal of a binary tree
	2. in-order traversal
	3. post-order traversal
	4. layer traversal
